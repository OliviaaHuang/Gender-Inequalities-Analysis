# Gender-inequalities-analysis

## 1.Introduction

Economic growth has promoted widespread social attention to STEM. Women are  willing to enter the STEM field increasingly and have begun to play important roles in the STEM, but there is a problem about gender imbalance in this field today. This project mainly explores the factors causing gender inequality in STEM fields.

Here is the data source: [Gender Data Source](./a2_gender.csv),[Geographic Information Dataset](./a3_Latitude_and_longitude.csv),[Students Detail Dataset](./a1_students_place_of_origin.csv)

## 2. Tools Used

`Pycharm` is used as IDE  

Used `Pandas` and `Numpy` to clean the data  

Used `Json`, `Requests`, `Pyecharts` and `Excel` to visualize the data

## 3.Data Visualization
Files beginning with `d1 to d8` used 3D map to show the number of student in each country receiving distance education in the UK from 2014 to 2021.

Files beginning with `c1 to c3` used bar chart to show the number of male and female students like different subjects from 2019 to 2021.

Files beginning with `f1` used stacked column chart to show male and female employees' perceptions of four factors(such as differences in behavior, differences in pay and promotion prospects, stereotypes, family-work imbalance) that contribute to gender inequality.

## 4. Conclusion
In this project, the main factors causing gender inequality in STEM fields are behavioral differences between boys and girls and stereotypes about female employees in the workplace.
